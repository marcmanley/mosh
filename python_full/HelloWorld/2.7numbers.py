# Numbers

x = 1
x = 1.1
x = 1 + 2j  # a + bi (where 'i' is an imaginary number)

# the above is an example of a complex number

# let's do some math!

print(10 + 3)
print(10 - 3)
print(10 * 3)
print(10 / 3)
print(10 // 3)  # this rounds the remainder
print(10 % 3)  # modulus
print(10 ** 3)  # exponent

# augmented assignment operator

x = 10
# x = x + 3
x += 3

# the second two are the same

print(x)
